ODDViz - TEI ODD Visualizer
===========================

Visualize an ODD customization against TEI-all.


Usage
-----

Generate a JSON of your customization using TEI XSLTS (odds2/odd2json.xsl) and save it as odd.js in testdata.

JSON is served asynchronously, so run this on a server. 

You can run a simple HTTP server on your machine like this:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888
